    "## Introduction\n",
    "### What is a Python package?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A Python package is basically a directory with a specific file structure.\n",
    "+ Within the package directory structure, there are *modules* which are files that end in `.py`.\n",
    "+ These modules allow you to group and structure your Python code.\n",
    "+ Each module contains *functions* and *classes*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation for Python packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use your code across different project\n",
    "+ Share your code\n",
    "+ Organize your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements of a Python package\n",
    "+ **Code**: Functions and classes that provide functionality for a user of your package\n",
    "+ **Documentation**: Installation instructions, tutorials, and examples\n",
    "+ **Tests**: Make sure your code works as it should \n",
    "+ **License**: Select a license for your package such that others also know how to re-use your package\n",
    "+ **Infrastructure**: Automate updates, publication workflows and runs test suites; includes platforms like GitHub and GitLab\n",
    "\n",
    "### The importance of version control\n",
    "+ Most Python packages live in an online version control platform such as GitHub or GitLab.\n",
    "+ GitHub and GitLab both run git for version control.\n",
    "+ Having your software under version control is important because it allows you to both track changes over time while also going back in history and undoing changes in the case that a change to the code base unexpectedly breaks something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python packages and environments\n",
    "+ You can install a Python package into a Python environment in the same way you might install NumPy or Pandas.\n",
    "+ Installing your package into an environment allows you to access it from any code run with that specific Python environment activated"
